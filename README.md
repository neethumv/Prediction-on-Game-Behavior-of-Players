# Prediction-on-Game-Behavior-of-Players

In this study, aim is to study whether it is possible to predict a specific game behavior in a Role Play Game, 
Fallout 3, based on playersâ€™ real world characteristics (e.g. personality trait scores, game expertise and gender 
information). Precise and correct prediction of in-game actions will, for example, help game designers provide more 
customized and dynamic contents to players. 

The results showed that a certain game behavior can be predicted with 87% prediction accuracy using a verified 
and robust logistic regression model. It is tested that the game behavior has significant association with several 
real world characteristics.
